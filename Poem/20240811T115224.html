<p>
I offer you lean streets, desperate sunsets, the moon of the jagged suburbs.
</p>

<p>
I offer you the bitterness of a man who has looked long and long at the lonely moon.
</p>

<p>
I offer you my ancestors, my dead men, the ghosts that living men have honoured in marble: my father's father killed in the frontier of Buenos Aires, two bullets through his lungs, bearded and dead, wrapped by his soldiers in the hide of a cow; my mother's grandfather &#x2013; just twentyfour &#x2013; heading a charge of three hundred men in Peru, now ghosts on vanished horses.
</p>

<p>
I offer you whatever insight my book may hold, whatever manliness or humour my life.
</p>

<p>
I offer you the loyalty of a man who has never been loyal.
</p>

<p>
I offer you that kernel of myself that I have saved somehow &#x2013; the central heart that deals not in words, traffics not with dreams and is untouched by time, by joy, by adversities.
</p>

<p>
I offer you the memory of a yellow rose seen at sunset, years before you were born.
</p>

<p>
I offer you the explainations of yourself, theories about yourself, authentic and suprising news of yourself.
</p>

<p>
I can give you my loneliness, my darkness, the hunger of my heart; I am trying to bribe you with uncertainty, with danger, with defeat.
